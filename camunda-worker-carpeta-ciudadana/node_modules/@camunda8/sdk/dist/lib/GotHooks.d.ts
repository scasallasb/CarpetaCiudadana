 * We will retry only once on 401 (see the BeforeRetryHook), because the worker polls continuously, and a worker that is misconfigured with an invalid secret will retry indefinitely.
 * This is not ideal, but it is the current behaviour. We need to ensure that such a worker does not flood the broker, so we cause a backoff.
